# --- Basic Site Configuration (Edit these for Sleepy to Rested) ---
# The base URL for your deployed website.
# For Netlify, it's best practice to set this via environment variables
# or netlify.toml so Hugo builds with the correct deploy URL.
# You can keep this as your custom domain if you plan to use netlify.toml
# or Netlify's built-in build logic for baseURL.
baseURL: 'https://pestpolicy.com/'

languageCode: 'en-us' # Your language code
title: 'Sleepy to Rested' # Your website's title
theme: "PaperModX" # Make sure this is "PaperModX"

permalinks:
  posts: "/:slug/" # Permalink structure for your articles

# --- Homepage Info / Banner Configuration (often theme-specific) ---

      Your guide to achieving genuine quality sleep. We help you go from feeling sleepy to being truly rested through practical tips and advice.
      # You can add more markdown content here for your banner.
