If you need to remove moss, mold, and mildew stains on your outdoor surfaces,

### 2. Operation of the Wet & Forget s
Wet & Forget is an excellent outdoor stain remover, including for your patio floor. But don't use the remover on the warmest or hot days since the heat could evaporate the solution.
The appropriate temperature will be over 32 degrees in the application time and 5 hours following the process. The moss stains will be cleared from the patio in about three weeks.
- So, how does Wet & Forget remove moss stains? Well, soak the pavers and driveway with the liquid until it gets to the base of that moss covering.
I used the Wet & Forget for the garden shed and the fence, removing the greenish algae, but I made sure I conducted effective rinsing.
No one loves to spend many hours cleaning their siding and shingles after applying a cleaning product. Wet & Forget will cover the outdoor surface and thus no rinsing or cleaning.
Therefore, with just some limited rainfall, the Wet & Forget-applied surfaces will be washed clean. The product will remove stains such as moss, mold, mildew, and algae from the outdoor covers.

### 3. Lichen stain Removal with Wet & Forget s
The wet & forget stain remover will effectively remove Lichen - which is a combination of fungus and algae that live in a symbiotic relationship.
Get your sprayer - same that suitable for spraying fertilizer and water on your plants. So, soak the lichen with a solution of the stain remover.
I would recommend roughly 15 minutes to soften the lichen's outer layer and thus penetrate to remove the lichens. The remover works on  750-2250 square feet considering surface porosity.
### 4. Working Process of the Wet & Forget
Consider the materials; the stain remover - Wet and Forget - will work well on
[fiberglass](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-fiberglass-boats/)
, Vinyl, teak, PVC steel, asphalt, concrete, ceramic, and plastic.
Wet & Forget works first by quickly penetrating those stains to remove bacteria, and it'll reactivate every time there is rainfall - removing debris and preventing further growth.
For mold that's grown on the roof, you may use other products to effectively scrub the shingles to remove the mold with excellent cleaning power effectively.
Compared to various roof-cleaning substances with a harsh ingredient, this stain remover is non-caustic, non-acidic, and beach-free.

However, the stain remover will work slowly, and thus you could require some re-application within the month - particularly for tough stains.

First, Wet & Forget will be super useful and safe to use both for your
[indoor & outdoor spaces](https://pestpolicy.com/can-you-use-exterior-paint-indoors/)
- as approved by EPA - it won't damage the surfaces under the mildew, moss, or mold.
As noted earlier, Wet & Forget does not include bleach, nor is it acidic or caustic - the formula is equally eco-friendly and biodegradable - which means that it's safe.
The product will be comfortable and safe to use as a stain remover  - apply the liquid on your stained surfaces - you won't need to rinse or scrub the surfaces using water.
You should use smart bottles and sprayers for the less messy and even easier application of the stain remover. With the triggers and nozzles in the

, you can get to great heights.
