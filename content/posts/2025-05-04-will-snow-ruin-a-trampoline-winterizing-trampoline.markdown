## Will Snow Ruin a Trampoline?
Well, it depends. If you live in areas that experience heavy snows, your trampoline is likely to get ruined.
The fear of snow ruining your trampoline shouldnt come between you and the fun youre likely to experience jumping in winter.

The heavy snows will build on the trampolines mat, making the springs overstretch. However, you can protect your trampoline by clearing the snow off using either a broom or a shovel on a continuous basis.
On the other hand, if you reside in those regions that dont experience heavy snow, its unlikely that your trampoline will get ruined. The bottom line is the regular maintenance of the structure.
Winter is just an ordinary period, and it shouldnt prevent you and your kids from having fun. I know winter can be icy, but hey, jumping will warm you up, just try it! Read Also:

## **Should You Disassemble Your Trampoline During Winter? **
Most trampoline owners ponder this question a lot. To answer it directly, I would say it depends. But, if you have enough storage space, you can always take them down and store to reassemble later.
It depends on the level of snow you usually experience in your area, the manufacturers opinion about the ability of the structure to survive in winter, and your personal preference. Read Also:

However, it is important to note that most trampolines are made of durable, rust-resistant materials, and therefore, there is no need of dissembling them during winter.
If you have decided to disassemble, you dont have to remove the entire structure. Only detach the springs, the soft frame, the safety netting, and the jumping mat. Read Also:

Leave all the poles that secure the safety netting as well as the frame metal that connects the mat and the springs standing outside.
