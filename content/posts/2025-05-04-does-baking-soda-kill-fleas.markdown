due to its ability to dry them out. By taking away the moisture found in a flea, they cannot survive since they cannot replenish it as quickly as the
[baking soda](https://pestpolicy.com/dont-use-vinegar-and-baking-soda-to-clean-clogged-drains/)
can take it away.
The same can be said for the

## How to Use Baking Soda to Kill Fleas
There are a variety of ways in which you can use baking soda to
[kill any fleas in the home](https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-kill-bed-bugs/)
; you can treat carpets, soft furnishing, and furniture as well as treat your pet.
- If it is possible, you should remove any animals from the room you are treating. This treatment will not cause any significant harm to your pet, but the salt can be uncomfortable if it gets into any open wounds.
- Take a shaker and mix salt and baking powder, then sprinkle this mixture evenly over the entire area you wish you treat, for example, your carpet.
- You should make sure that the baking soda you are using is active; this means that the best results will be seen from a packet which has been freshly opened.
- The treatment should be left for a good time, at least overnight, to allow it to do its work. Once you are ready, you can remove the baking soda and salt mixture by vacuuming the area as thoroughly as you can.
- It is important to discard the vacuum contents outside of the home to prevent the further infestation from occurring -[use flea foggers](https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-fleas/). It is also wise to clean your vacuum cleaner after ensuring that no[fleas or eggs](https://pestpolicy.com/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/)remain inside.
The treatment should be repeated a few days later as a precautionary measure to ensure that any flea eggs left behind are effectively dealt with. You can repeat the process a third time if you deem this to be necessary.
