. Use the

(or even the
[Electronic Flea Comb](https://pestpolicy.com/best-electronic-flea-comb/)
) and run it through the fur of your pet.
- You can also check for more fleas by looking into black specks in the fur and skin of your dog. If there are indeed, then it's time to act.
- In the battle against these creatures, time plays an important part.There are alternative[treatments for puppy fleas](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-puppies/)- comb the dog thoroughly.
While combing your dog's hair, you should have a standby bowl with you so that you can have something to place the contents of the comb after. Once you're done, you could drown the remaining material in the toilet.
## **3. Flea Collars**
You can try them all - including

using foggers that have also proven to eliminate fleas in the entire house effectively.

- There is no doubt that DE plus[borax](https://pestpolicy.com/borax-flea-killer/)is an excellent natural flea control method that can offer all-year-round protection against fleas.
You'll need to sprinkle the DE powder in the pet houses. Further, do not assume that locking your pet will prevent fleas from infestation. It is important to control the fleas inside the pet house too.
