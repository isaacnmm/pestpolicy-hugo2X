Previously, I discussed the
[top flea foggers](https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-fleas/)
, but we'll cover how you can get rid of cat flea eggs in this post.
In short, to get rid of flea eggs on cats, Bathe the
[cat with a flea shampoo](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-cats/)
, flea comb the cat's fur (with tightly-spaced tines), give oral
[cat flea medicine](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-treatment-for-cats/)
such as lufenuron, and kill adult fleas using cat medication such as nitenpyram twice per week.
**First off**
: Whats the negative effect of having
[fleas on your cat](https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/occas/catflea.htm)
or kittens? Notably, fleas will not just cause itching on your feline friends but will also trigger anemia, hair loss and could introduce tapeworms.

## **How to Get Rid of Flea Eggs on Cats Step By Step **
But, what color are flea eggs on a cat? Well, flea eggs have a rounded oval shape. If freshly deposited,
[flea eggs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/)
will look translucent white but change to pearl-like and opaque with time. Experts consider
[flea eggs as dandruff](https://pestpolicy.com/flea-eggs-vs-dandruff/)
flakes, salt grains, and tiny pearls shaped.
### 1. Bathe the cat with a flea shampoo
The kittens under 12 weeks old use ordinary
[dish soap](https://pestpolicy.com/dawn-dish-soap-for-fleas/)
to clean them up of any debris, fleas, and flea eggs.
However, mature cats, use cat
[flea shampoo](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-shampoo-for-dogs/)
to undertake the same role, mainly because adult cats can withstand insecticides and smell.
Cat flea shampoo has insecticides that will kill the adult frees and break their life cycle to stop them from further egg-laying. In this early bathing process, some
[flea eggs will be washed](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/)
off the cats fur.
### 2. Brush the cat's fur using a[Flea comb](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-comb-for-cats/)
Next, take the special
[flea comb](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-combs-for-dogs/)
. The flea comb must be designed to create closely spaced tines to comb the small fleas and any cat flea eggs present.
Therefore, upon running the
[flea combs](https://pestpolicy.com/best-electronic-flea-comb/)
a few times in the cat's fur, youll notice some back fleas and some rice-looking flea eggs coming off.
Ensure that the combing process is thorough on the cats chest and neck since fleas love the area - try
[flea control methods](http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7419.html)
.
### 3. Give oral cat flea preventative
Also, cover the flea comb with some petroleum jelly so that the flea eggs and small fleas can stick to it.
To clean off the fleas and their eggs, ensure that dip the comb into soapy water or some
[rubbing alcohol](https://pestpolicy.com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/)
 which also will suffocate and kill them.
