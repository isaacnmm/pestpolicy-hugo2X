## Details: What Do Flea Larvae Look Like?
It is often much more comfortable recognizing an adult
[flea or even a flea egg](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-flea-eggs/)
, but identifying flea larvae might be a little more complicated.
Before we begin to learn how to spot flea larvae, let's take a brief look at their

.
*The Life Cycle of a Flea*
- The first stage is the egg; these are small whitish objects around the size of a grain of salt and are notoriously difficult to notice.
- Next comes the larvae stage, which we will look at in more depth throughout this article.
- The third stage is the pupa when the flea enters into a cocoon and lies dormant for some time.
- Finally, the adult flea emerges, and this is what most people are familiar with.
The Flea Larvae
If you think you might have spotted
[flea larvae around your home](https://pestpolicy.com/home-remedies-for-fleas/)
, there are certain things to look out for, such as;
- A tiny worm-like creature is measuring between 2mm and 5mm in length.
- The creature will have a whitish color to it.
- It will be covered in tiny hairs, which are very light in color.
The flea larvae are known to feed on the flea dust, which is essentially the waste product left behind from the adult fleas, and so you might notice these creatures around areas where flea dust is present.

## Where Do Flea Larvae Hide Out?
The most popular
[place for the flea](https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-fleas-come-from/)
larvae is near the host animal, so you will often find them either on the animal itself or in areas where the animal is regularly present, such as its bed.
To the naked eye, you might notice tiny little C-shaped objects-these are the flea larvae. If you can spot them at this stage of their development, you are much more likely to tackle the flea problem as a whole.
If you kill them at this stage, this will stop them from hiding in nooks and crannies during the pupa stage, which is known to be much more challenging to tackle.
