First, does Valspar
[cabinet revamping paint](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-kitchen-cabinets-without-sanding/)
need a primer? Well, No! Valspar won't need a primer - it is simple to clear any blemishes with comfortable touch up in your kitchen and bathroom cabinets.

On effectiveness, Valspar Cabinet is suitable for furniture cabinets and will be comfortable to touch up if there are chips, blemishes, or scuffs -
[only sand](https://pestpolicy.com/best-belt-sander-for-deck/)
and apply the paint.
I recommend using
satin, gloss, or
[semi-gloss paints](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-kitchen-cabinets/)
for your kitchen cabinets - but avoid using
Matte. Valspar Signature is resistant to stains, spills, and scratches - it's also
[mildew resistant](https://pestpolicy.com/mildew-resistant-paints/)
.
So, below I've shared how the Valspar Cabinet-Enamel Paint will be an excellent tool for reviving the outlook of your different home projects, including on
[trim and baseboards](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-brush-for-trim-and-baseboards/)
.
## Details: Valspar Cabinet Paint
Painting your cabinet is different from the
[regular wall painting](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-for-concrete-walls-in-basement/)
since this type of cabinet painting project requires having a
[quality product](https://pestpolicy.com/best-white-paints-for-interior-walls/)
.
The cabinet paint must be solid to effectively withstand abuse such as food or liquid splashes and repeated touching - Valspar Cabinet also comes at a
[budget-friendly price](https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-paint-kitchen-cabinets/)
.
### 1. Latex-Based paint
The
[latex-based paint](https://pestpolicy.com/what-is-latex-paint-used-for/)
(Valspar Cabinet Enamel) is suitable and recommended for cabinet painting - but you must know that the product is a latex-oil hybrid.
The oil features in the paint will create that smooth and streak-free surface on your cabinets. Valspar Cabinet Paint does not include excessive
[volatile organic content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound)
(VOC).
Besides, with the Valspar paint, cleaning will be comfortable even with no turpentine. Get some soap and water for easy cleaning - and hence the paint offers great surface wash-ability and durability.
### 2. Has Glosser-like Features
With the Valspar Cabinet Enamel, you'll get the glosser-like properties on your surfaces, and hence you won't require to
[sand the wood before painting](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-sand-between-deck-boards/)
.
Notably, the enamel Valspar paints won't have that rock-hard finish, and thus no grains will appear - this is mainly because the oil property will generate that glossy finish.
The Valspar paint tends to dry plus cure but won't lead to environmental issues or yellowing on your cabinets in the
[master bathroom remodeling](https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/room-ideas/g25950227/master-bathroom-ideas/)
.
Besides, Valspar's latex feature makes the paint firmly adhere to your cabinet
[smooth finishes](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-roller-for-smooth-finish/)
, mainly if you're working on some old finish - which reduces peeling, scratching, and chipping.
### 3. Has Non-Yellowing Properties and Mild Smell
It's possible to paint with this Valspar on your old finishes. The paint will also leave no brush marks following the brushing process
[streak-free](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-with-a-roller-without-streaks/)
due to the oil and latex features.
The Valspar Cabinet Paint comes with non-yellowing features - and this prevents yellow patches from appearing on the cabinet paints after you've painted.
Compared to oil-based paints, the Valspar Cabinet Paint has a less mild odor. Therefore, you won't require to put on a nose mask - but you may need
[safety glasses](https://pestpolicy.com/best-safety-glasses-for-spray-painting/)
.
You'll not get allergies that result from strong-odor paints, and thus you'll be safe - great for
[baby cribs](https://pestpolicy.com/best-baby-safe-paint-for-crib/)
. See Also:

### 3. Produces a Professional Cabinet Finish
The Valspar Paint offers that great professional finish considering your unique painting technique. You may need to use sprayers, rollers, or
[paint with edging brushes](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-brushes-for-edging/)
.

[priming, before your painting](https://pestpolicy.com/best-oil-based-primer/)
, you might need to avoid

You will result in poor finishing if you don't prime the surfaces as it would lead to stain-bleeding via the paint. The surfaces, using Valspar, won't require sanding or priming.

Also, as noted above, with this cabinet paint, you won't require glossers or primers - this makes it even cheaper to achieve that smooth finish.
