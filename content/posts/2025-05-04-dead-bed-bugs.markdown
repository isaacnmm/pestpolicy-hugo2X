## Do You Know What a Dead Bed Bug Looks Like?
Usually,
[bed bugs are minute](https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/)

Instead, they have six legs. They vary in color; some are brown, while some are close to white. Check these
[pictures of bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/pictures-of-bed-bugs/)

After they have fed on enough blood, they appear to be reddish or dark. This one is caused by the color of blood.

The other thing is that before they reach the adult stage,

. Therefore, you need to look for exoskeleton in areas that they use for hiding.
You are likely to find them in your bed sheets and mattress seams. Their exoskeletons are pale yellow in color and to see them clearly, you will need a magnifying glass.
The last sign that you are about to deal with bed bugs is there eggs and eggshells beneath your mattress and bed frame. You might also see them in the crevices of your mattress.

## Can Dogs Carry Bed Bugs?
There is a possibility that your pet might have some bed bugs on their fur. This is true because their body can provide a perfect hiding haven for the bed bugs and other insects.
For safety purposes, you need to ensure that your pet does not have any bed bug on them before you start cleaning. Check their fur and if you find that they have bed bugs or signs of them, use a non-toxic
[spray to kill the bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/bedlam-plus-bed-bug-spray-review/)
.
However, this should be done carefully since some pets might have sensitive skin. Such pets tend to develop allergic reactions when sprayed.
There are special pills that are created for pets that have allergic skin. If your pet falls in that category, give it the pill, and it will form a
[toxic layer so that when bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/what-happens-when-you-squish-a-bed-bug/)
try to feed on their blood, they die and fall off.
You can talk to your vet for the best way to administer the pills so that your pet does not get hurt in the process of fighting the best bugs.
**Call an Exterminator**
