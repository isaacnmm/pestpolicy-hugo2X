## #2: My Detailed Review
### 1.Non-staining and No odor (Quite long)
Spectracide Bug Stop produces a fine mist that'll cover various surfaces to kill bed bugs but won't stain the clothing, furniture, linens, bedspreads, beds, and carpets.
Therefore, the insecticide reduces the cleaning cost that would be required after treating the
[areas for bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/)
. Further, the cost of replacing stained objects like clothes will be significantly reduced.
### 2.  On-contact Extermination Formula
Spectracide Bug Stop readily
[kills all the fleas](https://pestpolicy.com/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/)
, eggs, and larvae through the on-contact extermination method that's easy and highly effective.
This insecticide will also kill a range of other pets (equally through on-contact extermination), including different flying and crawling insects.
### 3. Deep Reaching Formula
The fogger produces a fine mist that'll penetrate
[deep into the bed bug's hiding](https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/)
places such as crevices and cracks or even smaller crannies and nooks.
Therefore, the insecticide will readily reach the hard places that tend to host bed bugs, eggs, and the larvae preparing to bring up another dangerous population.

## #3: My Experience:
### 1. Has a 2-weeks residue effect
Despite that Spectracide Bug Stop is marketed as an on-contact extermination solution for bed bugs, it also has a long residue effect - going up to 2 weeks.
Therefore, you'll need to apply the fogger in the recommended spaces (areas) after 2 weeks, where it'll kill all the
[adult bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/do-bed-bugs-jump/)
and the sterile bed bugs or roaches.
### 1. Is Spectracide Bug Stop Effective in cars?
The short answer is, YES! Just 1 Spectracide Bug Stop fogger will readily treat your car from all bed bugs and their larvae growing around. However, you'll need to leave the car trunk and the windows open.
However, you should be aware that the Spectracide Bug Stop fogger is meant to treat a confined space like a 5 x 5 rooms, and thus, you'll have to leave your car unused for 3-4 days after
