## #2: My Detailed Review
### 1.Non-staining Formula
Harris Bed Bug Killer won't stain your clothes, fabrics, or linen. The spray formula won't damage furniture finished despite leaving a residue that'll be active for long.
The long residue effect (7 to 10 days) means that the formula will continue
[killing bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs/)
over time and won't require frequent re-application after the first day.
### 2. Suitable for Indoor and Outdoor Spraying
This product will
[kill bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-ammonia-kill-bed-bugs/)
excellently for both your outdoor and indoor spaces.
- I would say that you'll require to combine this[spray with bed bug](https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/)baits.
However, Harris
[Bed Bug Killer is more effective](https://pestpolicy.com/tea-tree-oil-for-bed-bugs/)
in controlling bed bugs in indoor spaces where roaches tend to create their safe havens.
### 3. Liquid Spray formula
Being a spray formula, this product will be suitable to spray places that
[bed bugs are hiding](https://pestpolicy.com/where-do-bed-bugs-hide/)
or have created a bug nest.
- I found the nozzle to be highly convenient in distributing the liquid.
- Luckily, the liquid spray tends to dry out just about 5 minutes after the application.
Therefore, it's great to apply to your bedding, mattresses, and furniture.
### 4. Odorless formula (or mild smell)
In addition to being effective
[against bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/dead-bed-bugs/)
, this product is odorless and non-irritating to both human beings and your pets.
However, some customers note that they experience some mild (though non-irritating) smell, which would disapprove of the "odorless" claim.
## #3: My Experience:
### 1. Deltamethrin irritates the skin
Harris Bed Bug Killer contains the Deltamethrin that tends to irritate the human skin, particularly the eyes, and thus you must take care when spraying or use goggles.
However, the Deltamethrin in this product is less toxic if minimal amounts are eaten or ingested, and that person would tend to vomit a lot to remove the poison.
### 1. Bed bugs are resistant to Deltamethrin
It's a common fact that current bed bugs are continually developing resistance against Deltamethrin. Therefore, at the usual dosage, the bed bugs will still endure.
Recent
[research](https://www.npmapestworld.org/default/assets/File/newsroom/magazine/2015/nov-dec_2015.pdf)
shows that over 85 percent of the cockroaches don't die from exposing them to Deltamethrin-containing pesticides while also ranking bed bugs as the worst pests.
