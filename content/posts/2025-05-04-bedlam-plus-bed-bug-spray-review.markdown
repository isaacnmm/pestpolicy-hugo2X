Hey guys, and welcome. I've reviewed Bedlam Plus bed bug spray - one of our
[best bed bug sprays](https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/)
in this post.
Bedlam Plus residue will continue killing bed bugs for about 4 weeks after application. I note that it's great for carpeting, box springs, and mattresses.
- Luckily,[research reports that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808785/)more than 40 percent of the bed bug die when treated with Bedlam plus.
- For safety when using Bedlam Plus, make sure you read the label instructions.
First off, I note that Bedlam will also
[kill the bed bugs and the eggs](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-bed-bug-eggs/)
resistant to pesticides such as pyrethroids.
*So, let's get started! *
[amazon bestseller="Bedlam Plus Bed Bug Spray" items="2" template="table"]
## #1: Review Summary
So, Bedlam Plus is a residue formula, and hence even after applying, its active ingredients will continue repelling and
[killing bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-lysol-kill-bed-bugs/)
for about 1-4 weeks. Spray lightly on fabrics, drapes, sofas, mattresses, and
[mattress encasements](https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-mattress-encasements/)
.
- Luckily,[Bedlam Plus has no restrictions like other bed bug sprays](https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-spray/), and thus you can apply it at any location you'd apply to other liquids.
- But exclude pets and kids from the places where you've applied the Bedlam Plus until the aerosol has fully dried.

The active ingredients are n-octyl dicarboximide (bicycloheptene) in addition to sumithrin, which is a great chemical to allow you to kill the bed bugs readily.
Luckily, the new formula in this Bedlam Plus has imidacloprid, enhancing a faster knockdown
[effect even for different bed bug](https://pestpolicy.com/does-bleach-kill-bed-bugs/)
strains.
While spraying your sofas, you'll need to give special attention to corner cracks, folds, and seams since that's where you'll mainly find
[bed bugs, larvae, and their eggs](https://pestpolicy.com/what-does-bed-bug-poop-look-like/)
while still reducing their hatching rate. But, cover up your aquariums to protect your reptiles and fish.

## #2: My Detailed Review
I've used
[many bed bug](https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/)
control products, and I have to say that Bedlam Plus is definitely one of the best solutions we have out there. So, why and how did I end up selecting Bedlam Plus?
- Further, I found that Bedlam Plus was easy to apply (with the ready-to-go applicator) and equally made from natural ingredients.
- Luckily, Bedlam Plus was able to[kill even the bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-salt-kill-bed-bugs/)that had developed immunity against various pesticide ingredients such as pyrethroid.
Bedlam Plus didn't stain my clothes and fabrics. Besides that, it won't get waterlogged and won't lose its

such as bed bug frames and door frames.
